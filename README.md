# Go Fonts CSS

![Go Regular](go-regular.png)

![Go Mono](go-mono.png)

This repository contains CSS `@font-face`s for the
[Go fonts](https://blog.golang.org/go-fonts).

These fonts are under the same open-source license as the rest of the
Go project. The truetype files are taken directly from
[Google's git repository](https://go.googlesource.com/image).

I have only added two files: `go.css` and `go-mono.css`. Consider
these two files in the public domain.
